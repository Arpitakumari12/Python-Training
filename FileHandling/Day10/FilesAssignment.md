## 🔰 **Beginner-Level Questions (Concept + Code)**

1. **Open and Read File**

   - Write a Python program to read a file `notes.txt` and print its contents line-by-line.
   - 📌 _Concept tested_: File opening, reading, and loop.

```python
   # Open and read the file line by line
with open('notes.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes trailing newline characters
```

2. **Count Lines in a File**

   - Count how many lines exist in a file `poem.txt`.

```python
# Count the number of lines in poem.txt
with open('poem.txt', 'r') as file:
    line_count = sum(1 for _ in file)
print("Number of lines:", line_count)
```

3. **Write to a File**

   - Create a new file `reminder.txt` and write 5 tasks to it, one per line.

```python
# Write 5 tasks to reminder.txt
tasks = [
    "complete cloud assignment",
    "Complete Python assignment",
    "Call a friend",
    "Watching movie",
    "Read a book"
]

with open('reminder.txt', 'w') as file:
    for task in tasks:
        file.write(task + '\n')
```

4. **Append to a File**

   - Add a new task to `reminder.txt` without deleting existing ones.

```python
# Append a new task to reminder.txt
new_task = "Pay electricity bill"

with open('reminder.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write(new_task + '\n')
```

5. **Check File Exists**
   - Use `os.path.exists()` to check if `data.txt` exists before opening.

```python
import os

# Check if data.txt exists
if os.path.exists('data.txt'):
    with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
        print(file.read())
else:
    print("File data.txt does not exist.")
```

```python
import csv

# Filter sales > 10000
with open('sales.csv', 'r') as infile, open('high_sales.csv', 'w', newline='') as outfile:

    writer = csv.writer(outfile)

    header = next(reader)
    writer.writerow(header)  # Write header

    for row in reader:
        if float(row[1]) > 10000:  # Assuming column 2 is the amount
            writer.writerow(row)
```

folder = 'your_folder_path_here'  # replace with your actual path

for file in os.listdir(folder):
    if file.endswith('.txt') or file.endswith('.csv'):
        print(file)
```

## 🚀 **Bonus Challenges**

16. **Auto Backup System**

    - Copy the contents of `data.csv` into `backup/data_backup.csv` with the current date in the filename.

```python
import shutil
import datetime
import os

# Create backup folder if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs('backup', exist_ok=True)

# Generate backup filename with current date
date_str = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')
backup_filename = f"backup/data_backup_{date_str}.csv"

# Copy file
shutil.copyfile('data.csv', backup_filename)

print("Backup created:", backup_filename)
```
17. **Text Formatter**

    - Remove leading/trailing spaces and convert tabs to spaces in `raw_text.txt`.

```python
# Format raw_text.txt
with open('raw_text.txt', 'r') as infile, open('formatted_text.txt', 'w') as outfile:
    for line in infile:
        cleaned = line.strip().replace('\t', '    ')  # Replace tabs with 4 spaces
        outfile.write(cleaned + '\n')
```

18. **Chat History Logger**

    - Build a basic chat logger: take user input until “exit” and save all messages with timestamps to `chat_log.txt`.

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Chat logger
with open('chat_log.txt', 'a') as logfile:
    while True:
        message = input("You: ")
        if message.lower() == 'exit':
            break
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
        logfile.write(f"[{timestamp}] {message}\n")
```

19. **Custom CSV Sorter**

    - Read `products.csv` and sort by price (ascending). Write the sorted records to `products_sorted.csv`.

```python
import csv

# Sort products by price
with open('products.csv', 'r') as infile:
    reader = list(csv.reader(infile))
    header, data = reader[0], reader[1:]

    sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: float(x[1]))  # Assuming price is in column 2

with open('products_sorted.csv', 'w', newline='') as outfile:
    writer = csv.writer(outfile)
    writer.writerow(header)
    writer.writerows(sorted_data)
```

20. **JSON Converter**
    - Read `students.txt` with comma-separated values, convert it to a list of dictionaries, and write to `students.json`.

```python
import json

# Convert students.txt to JSON
students = []

with open('students.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        name, marks = line.strip().split(',')
        students.append({'name': name, 'marks': int(marks)})

with open('students.json', 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(students, json_file, indent=4)
```
